# shell.php

## 🚀 Advanced Features of shell.php

- 🗂️ **File Upload Backdoor:** This PHP script functions as a stealthy file upload backdoor, allowing unauthorized file uploads to the server.
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Highly Obfuscated:** The core functionality is hidden inside a Base64-encoded payload, decoded and executed dynamically using `eval()`, making it extremely difficult for antivirus and security scanners to detect.
- 🔐 **Secret Code Access Control:** Utilizes a secret code (`$secret_code`) as a gatekeeper to restrict access to the backdoor functionalities.
- 🧩 **Dynamic Code Execution:** The encoded payload can execute arbitrary PHP code, enabling a wide range of malicious operations beyond just file uploads.
- 🛡️ **Anti-Detection Techniques:** The combination of encoding and dynamic evaluation serves as a hacker-style cloak, evading signature-based detection systems.
- ⚡ **Minimal Footprint:** The entire backdoor is encapsulated in a compact, single PHP file, making it easy to deploy and hard to trace.
